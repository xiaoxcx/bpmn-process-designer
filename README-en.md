## Project Introduction

1. `vue 2 + JavaScript + bpmn-js@8+ + element-ui` In the `main` branch of this repository, it is the original code that most projects depend on, with more problems.

2. `vue 2 + JavaScript + bpmn-js@9+ + element-ui` In the `v2` branch of this repository, the style has been modified slightly, and the data interaction logic has been adjusted, but the core data update and processing part still has some defects.

3. `vue 3 + TypeScript + bpmn-js@13 + naive-ui` In the [moon-studio/vite-vue-bpmn-process](https://github.com/moon-studio/vite-vue-bpmn-process) repository, it is the predecessor of `v2`.


> The `next` branch is currently used as a pnpm workplace test branch, and there are significant differences from the above content (currently not available for use).
> 
> In addition, the above 1, 2, 3 three branches are relatively early versions of the project, although the user base is relatively large, there are still many problems, and it is recommended to develop again after understanding the code.
> 
> The `next` branch provides basic bpmn-js tool methods, based on the official camunda property panel, and has been tested multiple times, basically meeting most needs.
>
> If you need it directly, you can combine it with the system for use, and the version that has fixed the core business logic problems has been released, you can contact the commercial version above.
